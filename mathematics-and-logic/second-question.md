# Sarah assumes her watch is 5 minutes late, but it is actually 10 minutes early. Sarah arrives for an appointment thinking she is 15 minutes late compared to the scheduled time. When did she actually arrive? On time, late or early? In case she arrived early, by how many minutes?

## Answer:

- X is the hours
- Sarah assumes her WATCH is 5 min late, it is X - 5.
- But it is 10 min early, it is X - 10, because it have 10 minutes more than original time.
- Sarah arrives thinking 15 min late compared to schedule time, it is X + 15.
- X = 15 - 10 - 5 = 0

Sarah is on time.
