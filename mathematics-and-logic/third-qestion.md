## Answer:

- [ ] (a) "Take two, pay one"
- [ ] (b) "Take three and pay one"
- [ ] (c) "Take three, pay two"
- [x] (d) "Take four and pay for three"
- [ ] (e) "Take five, pay four"

First, we divide the price per quantity of pizzas, like:

- 1,5/2 = 0,75;

Now we calculate the other options:

- (a) 1/2 = 0,5;
- (b) 1/3 = 0,33;
- (c) 2/3 = 0,67;
- (d) 3/4 = 0,75;
- (e) 4/5 = 0,8;

The same discount is the letter D.
